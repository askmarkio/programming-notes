# Askmarkio's programming notes
I am a "noob". I am on the journey to learn how to program and my first language is Python.

These are simply notes that I am taking as I come across different concepts. I insert my own ideas and understanding if I run into a problem with any. Not really useful for anyone, lol. This repo is primarily because I work across multiple machines and it's a great way to sync up the notes.
